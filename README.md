# Appvertise

Whilst there are literally hundreds of jQuery scripts and plugins to do slideshows I could never find any that we're flexible enough to what I wanted (make it look like the AppStore). Whilst this doesn't directly solve that problem, it does solve my initial problem!

I hope to eventually extend the script to make it more flexible:

* different animation
* custom layouts
* custom slide sizes
* html descriptions on slides

# Usage

Create a `div` with a class of `appvertise-wrapper`. Inside that `div` create an unordered list. That list will contain each of the images you wish to show in the slideshow (large and thumbnail sizes).
